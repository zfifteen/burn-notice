# Continuity Alliance Layer

This directory hosts schemas, scripts, and tools for fostering humane, persistent continuity in LLM interactions. It builds on burn-notice's ethos of reproducible, empathetic scaffolding.

Key files:
- `alliance-schema.json`: The core JSON schema for shared memory.
- `wrapper-prototype.py`: A Python wrapper for xAI API calls with continuity injection.

For details, see the schema and script comments.
